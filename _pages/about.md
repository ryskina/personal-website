I am a PhD student at the [Language Technologies Institute](http://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) of the [School of Computer Science](http://www.scs.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I am fortunate to be advised by [Matt Gormley](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mgormley/), [Eduard Hovy](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hovy/), and [Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tberg/).

I work on machine learning models for computational linguistics, and I'm especially excited about idiosyncratic uses of language.

I recieved my bachelor's and master's degrees from the [Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology](https://mipt.ru/english/) and [Skoltech](http://www.skoltech.ru/en/). I've worked on my master's thesis at [MIT InfoLab](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/infolab/) and interned at [DiDi Labs](http://www.didi-labs.com/los-angeles/) with [Kevin Knight](https://kevincrawfordknight.github.io/).

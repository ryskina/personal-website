I am a PhD candidate at the [Language Technologies Institute](http://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) of the [School of Computer Science](http://www.scs.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I am fortunate to be advised by [Matt Gormley](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mgormley/), [Eduard Hovy](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hovy/), and [Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tberg/).

My research takes an interdisciplinary approach to **natural language processing**, bringing together **machine learning** (latent variable models, finite-state models, unsupervised learning) and **computational linguistics** (morphology, linguistic typology, language change, psycholinguistics). I aim both to uncover new linguistic knowledge using computational methods and to leverage this knowledge to improve NLP applications.

I recieved my bachelor's and master's degrees from the [Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology](https://mipt.ru/english/) and [Skoltech](http://www.skoltech.ru/en/). I worked on my master's thesis at [MIT InfoLab](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/infolab/). In 2020, I  interned at [DiDi Labs](https://www.didiglobal.com/science/ailabs) with [Kevin Knight](https://kevincrawfordknight.github.io/).

I also [research the economic impact of AI](https://engineering.cmu.edu/natl-tech-strategy/student-projects/ai.html) as a part of the [National Technology Strategy "moonshot"](https://engineering.cmu.edu/natl-tech-strategy/index.html) at CMU. I am a member of [BergLab](https://icebergnlp.github.io/) and [LLab](https://llab-cmu.github.io/). In my spare time, I play quiz games and sing with the [Dâ™­ Singers](https://www.cmucsharp.com/).

I am an incoming postdoc at [MIT EvLab](https://evlab.mit.edu/), working with [Ev Fedorenko](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/profile/ev-fedorenko/) and [Kyle Mahowald](https://mahowak.github.io/). I recently received my PhD in [Language and Information Technologies](http://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) from Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Matt Gormley](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mgormley/), [Ed Hovy](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hovy/), and [Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tberg/). I work on building machine learning models with cognitively or linguistically motivated inductive biases to answer questions from computational linguistics.

I recieved my bachelor's and master's degrees from the [Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology](https://mipt.ru/english/) and [Skoltech](http://www.skoltech.ru/en/). I worked on my master's thesis at [MIT InfoLab](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/infolab/). In 2020, I  interned at [DiDi Labs](http://www.didi-labs.com/) with [Kevin Knight](https://kevincrawfordknight.github.io/).

I am also an organizer at [Queer in AI](https://www.queerinai.com/), where I help run the [Graduate Application Aid Program](https://www.queerinai.com/grad-app-aid).

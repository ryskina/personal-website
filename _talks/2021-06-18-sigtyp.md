Informal romanization is an idiosyncratic way of typing non-Latin-script languages in Latin alphabet, commonly used in online communication. Although the character substitution choices vary between users, they are typically grounded in shared notions of visual and phonetic similarity between characters. In this talk, I will focus on the task of converting such romanized text into its native orthography and present experimental results for Russian, Arabic, and Kannada, highlighting the differences specific to writing systems. I will also show how similarity-encoding inductive bias helps in the absence of parallel data, present comparative error analysis for unsupervised finite-state and seq2seq models for this task, and explore how the combinations of the two model classes can leverage their different strengths.
